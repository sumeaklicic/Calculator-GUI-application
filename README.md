# Calculator-GUI-application
Using JAVA, I got a calculator that offers basic mathematical operations.

The application is easy to use. It only asks the user to enter numbers and select an operator.

The calculator offers the possibility to enter two operands with which we will work. Below we have four buttons with 4 operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication and division). By choosing the operator and entering the numbers, we get the result.
